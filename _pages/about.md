I am currently a graduate student at Antai College of Economics and Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Before joining Shanghai Jiao Tong University, I worked in the auditing industry for over four years. Before resigning, I held the position of Project Manager. Since my undergraduate studies, my research interests have consistently focused on the quality of financial reporting, the identification of financial fraud, and audit quality. Additionally, I have a keen interest in research related to corporate governance and fairness. I plan to channel my passion into research in the field of accounting, which will be my future pursuit.

About this Page
======
I hope to connect with more people through this webpage, and I will also share my personal experiences and observations here.



I plan to create three sections: 

1. Curriculum Vitae

   In this section, I will present my personal CV.

2. Blog Posts

   In this section, I will update some personal blog posts.

   **NB** *I will likely write blog posts in Chinese, and additionally, I will provide an English document translated by AI.*

3. LiteratureLog

   In this section, I will place introductions to some interesting literature that I have read.

   You can also find the markdown files of these notes in my GitHub repository.
