I am currently a graduate student at Antai College of Economics and Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Before joining Shanghai Jiao Tong University, I worked in the auditing industry for over four years. Before resigning, I held the position of Project Manager. 



Since my undergraduate studies, my research interests have consistently focused on the quality of financial reporting, the identification of financial fraud, and audit quality. Additionally, I have a keen interest in research related to corporate governance and fairness. I plan to channel my passion into research in the field of accounting, which will be my future pursuit.

Introduction

## 1. LiteratureLog



I have created a repository on Github to share interesting literature that I have read. I named this project "LiteratureLog." The project mainly consists of three sections, each corresponding to literature in the field of accounting, economics, and research methodology. If you are interested in these literatures, you are welcome to download the notes in Markdown format.



You can click the following link to directly access this project:

**NB** *This is a weekly updated project, and I usually update it on Sundays.*



## 2. Curriculum Vitae



You can click on the navigation bar above to view my personal CV, which seems to be a must-have item for every personal site. : )



## 3. Blog



You can click on the navigation bar above to view my personal blog. I plan to share content related to accounting and auditing practices in this section. I will focus more on cases of financial fraud and my reflections, while also incorporating my own work experience. All articles will be written in Chinese as the original draft, with an English version provided by AI translation.



However, this personal homepage has just been set up, and I may need some time to figure out how to use it.
