I am currently an Audit Specialist in the Internal Audit Department at J&T Express Group. I hold a Master of Business Administration from Antai College of Economics and Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Prior to pursuing my master’s degree, I accumulated over four years of experience in the auditing industry, most recently serving as a Project Manager.

My research interests, since undergraduate studies, have centered on financial reporting quality, financial fraud detection, and audit quality. I also maintain a strong interest in corporate governance and fairness-related issues. 

My master’s thesis focused on the relationship between internal pay disparity and firm performance. This research was motivated by observations of modern corporate compensation structure designs and the central government’s policies aimed at regulating executive pay in state-owned enterprises (SOEs). From an economic perspective, a higher pay ceiling helps attract talented individuals and motivates employees to strive for promotion and salary increases. This explains why, over the past two decades, top graduates from business schools and other disciplines have been drawn into high-paying industries such as investment banking and hedge funds. However, excessive pay gaps may also trigger public concerns over income inequality, particularly regarding high executive compensation in SOEs—a key factor likely prompting government-imposed pay restrictions. Salary serves as a price signal reflecting labor market supply and demand. The question remains whether administrative interventions in pay structures might undermine incentive mechanisms and, consequently, affect corporate performance.

Moving forward, I intend to dedicate my efforts to academic research in the field of accounting.

Introduction

## 1. LiteratureLog



I have created a repository on Github to share interesting literature that I have read. I named this project "LiteratureLog." The project mainly consists of three sections, each corresponding to literature in the field of accounting, economics, and research methodology. If you are interested in these literatures, you are welcome to download the notes in Markdown format.



Some mathematical formulas may not display properly on Github, but they appear correctly in Typora. You can achieve a perfect reading experience by downloading the file.

## 2. Curriculum Vitae



You can click on the navigation bar above to view my personal CV, which seems to be a must-have item for every personal site. : )



## 3. Blog



You can click on the navigation bar above to view my personal blog. I plan to share content related to accounting and auditing practices in this section. I will focus more on cases of financial fraud and my reflections, while also incorporating my own work experience. All articles will be written in Chinese as the original draft, with an English version provided by AI translation.



However, this personal homepage has just been set up, and I may need some time to figure out how to use it.
