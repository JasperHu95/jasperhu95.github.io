# The Mystery of Kangmei Pharmaceutical's Fraud


## 1. Introduction

Kangmei Pharmaceutical's financial fraud case is one of the most egregious instances of listed company financial misconduct in China's A-share market over the past decade, causing significant shockwaves in the market. Once upon a time, Kangmei Pharmaceutical was considered a "white horse stock" (referring to stocks with long-term performance excellence, high returns, and high investment value) in the traditional Chinese medicine industry. However, it has now become a company that everyone condemns for fraud, which is truly lamentable.

According to the penalty decision issued by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), the charges of financial fraud are listed as follows:

> 1. The 2016 Annual Report, 2017 Annual Report, 2018 Semi-Annual Report, and 2018 Annual Report contained false records, with inflated revenue, interest income, and operating profit.
>
> The 2016 Annual Report inflated revenue by 8.999 billion yuan, overstated interest income by 151 million yuan, and inflated operating profit by 656 million yuan, accounting for 16.44% of the total profit disclosed in the consolidated profit and loss statement for that period. The 2017 Annual Report inflated revenue by 10.032 billion yuan, overstated interest income by 228 million yuan, and inflated operating profit by 1.251 billion yuan, accounting for 25.91% of the total profit disclosed in the consolidated profit and loss statement for that period. The 2018 Semi-Annual Report inflated revenue by 8.484 billion yuan, overstated interest income by 131 million yuan, and inflated operating profit by 2.029 billion yuan, accounting for 65.52% of the total profit disclosed in the consolidated profit and loss statement for that period. The 2018 Annual Report inflated revenue by 1.613 billion yuan and inflated operating profit by 165 million yuan, accounting for 12.11% of the total profit disclosed in the consolidated profit and loss statement for that period.

> 2. The 2016 Annual Report, 2017 Annual Report, and 2018 Semi-Annual Report contained false records, with inflated cash and cash equivalents.
>
> From January 1, 2016, to June 30, 2018, Kangmei Pharmaceutical inflated its cash and cash equivalents through unrecorded financial transactions, false accounting entries, forging and altering large fixed-term deposit certificates or bank reconciliation statements, and coordinating revenue fraud by forging sales receipts. Through these methods, Kangmei Pharmaceutical inflated its cash and cash equivalents by 22.548 billion yuan in the 2016 Annual Report, accounting for 41.13% of the total assets disclosed and 76.74% of the net assets; inflated its cash and cash equivalents by 29.944 billion yuan in the 2017 Annual Report, accounting for 43.57% of the total assets disclosed and 93.18% of the net assets; and inflated its cash and cash equivalents by 36.188 billion yuan in the 2018 Semi-Annual Report, accounting for 45.96% of the total assets disclosed and 108.24% of the net assets.

> 3. The 2018 Annual Report contained false records, with inflated fixed assets, construction in progress, and investment properties.
>
> Kangmei Pharmaceutical included six previously unreported projects in its 2018 Annual Report: Bozhou Huatuo International Traditional Chinese Medicine City, Puning Traditional Chinese Medicine City, Puning Traditional Chinese Medicine City TCM Clinic, Bozhou New World, Gansu Longxi Traditional Chinese Medicine City, and Yulin Traditional Chinese Medicine Industrial Park. These projects were adjusted to increase fixed assets by 1.189 billion yuan, construction in progress by 401 million yuan, and investment properties by 2.015 billion yuan, totaling an increase of 3.605 billion yuan in total assets. Upon investigation, the six projects included in the 2018 Annual Report did not meet accounting recognition and measurement criteria, resulting in an inflation of fixed assets by 1.189 billion yuan, construction in progress by 401 million yuan, and investment properties by 2.015 billion yuan.
>
> 4. The 2016 Annual Report, 2017 Annual Report, and 2018 Annual Report contained significant omissions, failing to disclose related-party transactions involving non-operating funds occupied by the controlling shareholder and its affiliates.
>
> From January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018, Kangmei Pharmaceutical provided non-operating funds totaling 11.619 billion yuan to the controlling shareholder and its affiliates for purposes such as purchasing stocks, repaying financing capital and interest on behalf of the controlling shareholder and its affiliates, advancing funds for collateral release, or paying acquisition premiums, without going through decision-making or authorization procedures.
>
> According to Article 66, Paragraph 6 of the 2005 Securities Law and the "Content and Format of Annual Reports for Companies with Publicly Issued Securities" (CSRC Announcement [2016] No. 31, CSRC Announcement [2017] No. 17), Kangmei Pharmaceutical should have disclosed the related-party transactions involving non-operating funds occupied by the controlling shareholder and its affiliates in the relevant annual reports. However, Kangmei Pharmaceutical failed to disclose this information in the 2016 Annual Report, 2017 Annual Report, and 2018 Annual Report, resulting in significant omissions.

Among these, the most shocking aspect is Kangmei Pharmaceutical's fraudulent activities in cash and cash equivalents (bank deposits), with an amount exceeding 36 billion yuan. Even when looking at the history of financial fraud worldwide, no company before Kangmei Pharmaceutical had inflated cash and cash equivalents by more than 5 billion US dollars. Undoubtedly, Kangmei Pharmaceutical's fraud case is not only a major event in China's capital market but also a major event in the global capital market, and it can even be called the "king of cash fraud."

Although articles analyzing Kangmei Pharmaceutical's financial fraud have already flooded Chinese internet, financial fraud itself is a highly information-asymmetric behavior, which leads me to still have doubts about this case. Additionally, although Kangmei Pharmaceutical has now been taken over by state-owned capital from Guangdong Province and its performance is gradually recovering, the case still has high research value.

## 2. The Enigma Behind Financial Fraud

### 2.1 The Role of Banks in the Case

In the previous section, I mentioned Kangmei Pharmaceutical's shocking fraudulent activities in cash and cash equivalents. Although many analysts have pointed out Kangmei Pharmaceutical's fraudulent methods, I still have strong doubts about the details.

Numerous articles suggest that Kangmei Pharmaceutical forged relevant bank documents to achieve such a large-scale fraud in cash and cash equivalents. However, can a company simply forge documents to achieve such a large-scale fraud? As a former practitioner in the auditing industry, I strongly doubt this. The audit of bank deposits is not a simple matter of confirmation; it also involves a large amount of verification work, such as checking bank statements (audit of the amount of transactions during the accounting period). Given this, can bank deposits be inflated merely by forging fixed-term deposit certificates and bank reconciliation statements?

Based on this, I strongly suspect that banks were involved in Kangmei Pharmaceutical's fraud process, providing a large number of false documents to Kangmei Pharmaceutical and replying with false confirmation letters to auditing institutions at the end of the period. This seems to be the only reasonable explanation. Kangmei Pharmaceutical's headquarters is located in Puning City, Guangdong Province, where the GDP in 2018 was approximately 70.6 billion yuan. How much did Kangmei Pharmaceutical inflate its bank deposits? About 36.2 billion yuan! This inflated amount even exceeded half of Puning City's GDP that year. I find it hard to believe that such a huge amount was entirely forged by the company's internal personnel.

However, when I suspect that banks were involved in Kangmei Pharmaceutical's fraud process, another question arises: why would banks help Kangmei Pharmaceutical with such a large-scale fraud? On one hand, Kangmei Pharmaceutical's inflated amount is unprecedented, and on the other hand, this amount is extremely large for the city it is located in. If you were a senior bank manager, wouldn't you worry about the extremely high risks behind this behavior? Of course, for those who break the law, risk is not important; profit is important. So, what kind of profit could match such high risks?

### 2.2 The Starting Year of Financial Fraud

In the field of financial fraud, there is a well-known "iceberg theory," which states that discovered financial fraud may only be the tip of the iceberg, indicating that a company's fraudulent behavior may have started in previous accounting years. So, when did Kangmei Pharmaceutical's financial fraud begin?

In fact, as early as 2012, there were doubts about Kangmei Pharmaceutical, although the focus of the doubts at that time was on the land use rights held by Kangmei rather than the later-accused inflation of bank deposits. Today, we are powerless to verify whether the doubts at that time were valid, but I tend to believe that Kangmei had already started financial fraud in 2012, or even earlier. For those despicable actual controllers of listed companies, financial fraud is like taking drugs, bringing a sense of illusion. However, no drug addict starts with high-purity drugs from the beginning. Similarly, no financial fraudster starts with overly absurd methods from the beginning. In fact, financial fraud is an endless chain of lies: one lie requires countless lies to cover up. Eventually, this huge bubble will burst.

## 3. Personal Speculations

In the previous section, I raised two questions: 1. The motivation for banks to assist in fraud. 2. The starting time of Kangmei Pharmaceutical's fraud. In my opinion, these two questions are not isolated but should be considered together. Discussions on motivation are often considered more important, but time is a more fundamental dimension. We cannot analyze motivation crudely without considering the factor of time.

Imagine, if you were a senior manager of a local bank, would you choose to assist Kangmei Pharmaceutical in such a large-scale and bizarre fraud? I believe most people would say no. Because before the Kangmei case, there was no listed company that had implemented such a large-scale inflation of bank deposits, which also indicates that previous bank executives were not so bold.

So, what factors drove this joint fraud? Here, I speculate that it might be the administrative power that led to this situation.

### 3.1 Local Government-Enterprise Collusion

Since the reform and opening up, China has experienced rapid economic growth, but this development has also been accompanied by a series of problems. Although the central government has intensified its anti-corruption efforts since 2012, corruption has deep-rooted characteristics, and there are still high-ranking officials falling due to corruption.

Corruption is not only a political issue; it is closely linked to the economy, similar to the "revolving door" phenomenon in American politics. When we shift from a macroeconomic perspective to a micro-enterprise operation, this connection becomes even more apparent, showing the systemic nature of the problem.

In the Kangmei Pharmaceutical case, the former chairman Ma Xingtian bribed several local officials, including Wan Qingliang and Chen Hongping, the former party secretaries of Jieyang City. It is worth noting that Puning City, where Kangmei Pharmaceutical is located, is administratively under Jieyang City. Additionally, in June 2024, Hu Huanhua, the former party secretary of Puning, was also investigated for disciplinary and legal violations. The officials bribed by Ma Xingtian were not limited to the municipal level but also included officials at other levels.

China is vast, with a land area comparable to that of the entire European continent. In Europe, there is fierce competition between countries, raising a question: Is there similar competition among provinces and cities in China? My view is that such competition does exist, and it is not determined by the political system but by human nature.

This competitive relationship provides motivation for cooperation between local governments and enterprises. In many cases, the relationship between entrepreneurs and government officials is not as one-sided and unequal as we usually imagine. In fact, many local government officials are very willing to support local enterprises to promote local economic development. In this interaction, issues of corruption and collusion between government and business may arise. With the help of administrative power, some enterprises can achieve growth far exceeding that of other enterprises in the same industry. This rapid growth can significantly contribute to the local GDP, drive the development of related industries, and create jobs for local residents.

For local government officials, these development achievements are a reflection of their political achievements and an important indicator of their work performance. Therefore, they have a strong motivation to promote this cooperation to achieve rapid economic growth and personal political achievements. Although this motivation and behavior pattern have promoted local economic development to some extent, they may also lead to unfair resource allocation and the proliferation of corrupt practices.

Moreover, the collusive relationship between government and business is not static but evolves dynamically with the growth of enterprises. As enterprises expand, they may gradually gain influence over the government, even exerting pressure on the government. Taking Kangmei Pharmaceutical as an example, it supports the livelihoods of thousands of local residents. If the enterprise were to go bankrupt due to financial fraud, it would not only lead to massive unemployment but also affect the vast number of farmers who rely on supplying raw materials to Kangmei Pharmaceutical for their income. The collapse of the enterprise would have a significant impact on their lives.

As a former practitioner in the auditing industry, I firmly support severe crackdowns on financial fraud. However, for local government officials, this issue is far more than just simple punishment. They face a complex dilemma: on one hand, the enterprise indeed has serious illegal activities; on the other hand, the sudden collapse of the enterprise would have a huge impact on the local economy. This constitutes a difficult dilemma, reflecting the complex mechanisms behind financial fraud. This complexity may also be one of the reasons why the investigation and handling of Kangmei Pharmaceutical's financial fraud case took a long time.

### 3.2 The Universality of This Phenomenon

Although this case is discussed in the context of China, the issue may be universal. As mentioned earlier, the root of competitive relationships is not the political system but human nature. As long as there is competition, there will inevitably be game theory.

In China, this competitive relationship manifests as competition between provinces and cities. In the United States, this competition may manifest as the struggle between the two major parties. Imagine, could the Democratic and Republican parties provide special favors to certain enterprises in order to win votes in swing states? Furthermore, we can explore the dynamic evolution of government-business relations. As certain American enterprises grow in size, could they exert pressure on Washington?

If an economic interest group can influence political decisions, such as influencing decisions in Washington, could they also exert influence in New York?

This issue of financial fraud triggered by the complex government-business relationship may be universal across the globe.
