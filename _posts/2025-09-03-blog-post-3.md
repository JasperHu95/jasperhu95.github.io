While macro forecasts herald recovery and policy rhetoric champions consumption-led growth, firm-level practices — rewarding layoffs and overtime as cost discipline — render invisible the labor market stagnation that undermines both household demand and the sustainability of the very recovery they presume.

# Rising Expectations, Freezing Jobs

## 1. The Flip Side of Optimism

Over the past five years, public discourse on China’s economic outlook has remained at the center of national attention. Faced with a complex economic reality, public perception often gravitates toward binary narratives — either unreservedly optimistic or deeply pessimistic. While such simplification aids information dissemination, it obscures the multitude of nuanced factors shaping the real economy. In current debates, optimists emphasize China’s past achievements and believe its prior success trajectory will continue; pessimists, by contrast, focus on mounting domestic and external pressures — such as local government debt and U.S.-China trade tensions — warning that these may trap China in the “middle-income trap.”

In my view, mainstream discourse exhibits a pronounced tilt toward optimism. This perception may be shaped by multiple forces: homogenized social circles fostered by information cocoons, algorithm-driven selective content exposure, and institutional guidance within public discourse spaces. Yet this optimism stands in stark contrast to the persistent weakness in the labor market: youth unemployment remains elevated, job quality has deteriorated, and the economy’s capacity to generate new employment has significantly weakened. This dissonance raises a fundamental question: **If the economy is truly recovering, why has the job market failed to warm in tandem?**

## 2. Labor Market and the Consumption Conundrum

The prevailing consensus on China’s economic transition calls for shifting growth drivers from investment and exports toward a domestic consumption-led, internal-demand-driven model. Since late 2024, consumption subsidy policies rolled out by governments at all levels reflect precisely this strategic orientation. Yet a foundational question emerges: **Can household consumption capacity — under such a weak labor market — genuinely sustain this transformation?**

Consumption rests on two fundamental prerequisites: **disposable income** and **temporal-spatial freedom**. Today’s labor market, however, subjects workers to a dual squeeze. On one hand, layoffs disrupt income streams, directly eroding purchasing power. On the other, excessive overtime traps workers in a state of “income without leisure,” severely limiting their ability to engage in meaningful consumption. The combined effect of income contraction and time poverty suppresses the real consumption potential of households — undermining the microeconomic foundations of a “consumption-driven” growth model.

Historically, many firms improved short-term financial performance by compressing labor costs. This strategy typically manifests in two forms: layoffs to reduce wage expenditures, and extended working hours to maintain output. On financial statements, such “cost-cutting for efficiency” translates into improved profit margins — becoming an ingrained corporate response to growth pressure.

Although a cohort of Chinese firms with significant technological advantages has emerged in recent years, the international competitiveness of most enterprises still relies, to a considerable extent, on relatively low labor costs. This view, however, is contested in both academia and industry. Critics point out that labor costs in Southeast Asian countries are markedly lower than in China, suggesting that “cheap labor” is not a uniquely Chinese competitive advantage.

In fact, labor cost must be understood as a relative concept — not reducible to absolute wage levels alone. When factors such as skill level, productivity, and work discipline are accounted for, Chinese labor often outperforms its Southeast Asian counterparts across multiple key indicators. In other words, while direct hiring costs may be lower in Southeast Asia, unit output tends to be correspondingly lower as well. Judged by input-output efficiency, Chinese firms’ human capital investments in Southeast Asia may not yield higher marginal returns than those made domestically.

## 3. The Illusion of Layoffs

For most firms, when accounting profits come under pressure, layoffs are often management’s default cost-control mechanism. This preference stems from two key drivers: first, layoffs rapidly reduce labor expenses, with financial effects visible on income statements within a single reporting cycle; second, by contrast, achieving cost savings through technological upgrading or process optimization typically requires extended payback periods and organizational adaptation — ill-suited to satisfy management’s demand for short-term financial performance.

In practice, firms frequently resort to layoffs during economic downturns to contain costs, then experience profit rebounds during recovery phases as revenues rise. At this point, management often attributes improved profitability to the “strategic foresight” of prior layoffs. Yet the true story may be otherwise: profit recovery is more likely driven by macroeconomic factors — such as broad-based demand revival and sectoral upswings — rather than any “efficiency gain” generated by layoffs themselves.

When corporate performance improves sustainably, management often perceives existing headcount as insufficient to support future growth, prompting renewed hiring. Such cyclical adjustment is not inherently problematic — flexibly calibrating payroll to align with financial targets is fully compliant with accounting standards and governance norms. The real concern lies in the systemic overreliance on this cyclical labor-adjustment playbook, while structurally neglecting sustainable cost control through technological innovation, process automation, or organizational efficiency gains.

This path dependence raises a critical question: Do firms that maintain — or even expand — their workforce during downturns simultaneously achieve substantive technological advancement? If no breakthrough occurs at the technological level, rigid labor costs cannot be offset by productivity growth, ultimately leading to performance deterioration.

In economic downturns, managerial decisions regarding workforce size — whether contractionary layoffs or strategic retention — should not be viewed merely as short-term cost tools. Rather, they serve as critical signals of a firm’s technological evolution trajectory and organizational capability-building. Firms choosing to sustain human capital investment often embed strategic bets on productivity enhancement, process reengineering, or technological substitution. Conversely, those repeatedly resorting to layoffs to weather cyclical volatility may reveal a strategic deficit in structural efficiency improvement. Ultimately, variation in workforce decisions reflects firms’ underlying capacity to balance “labor cost rigidity” against “technological elasticity.”
