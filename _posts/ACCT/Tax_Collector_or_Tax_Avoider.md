## Summary

This paper investigates the balance between tax collection and tax avoidance motivations among local governments in China, against the backdrop of the 2002 tax sharing reform. By analyzing this reform, the study reveals how intergovernmental agency conflicts impact local governments' control over corporate tax avoidance behaviors. 



**The authors propose and test three hypotheses, finding that local governments are more inclined to avoid taxes when their shareholding ratio exceeds the tax sharing ratio, particularly in the context of significant fiscal deficits and high profit distribution ratios.**

## Introduction

- **Research Background and Issues**: This study examines the dual role of local governments in China's tax system, where they act both as tax collectors and as controlling shareholders of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The core issue is how local governments balance their motivations between tax collection and tax avoidance.
- **Research Objectives**: The paper aims to investigate how local governments balance tax collection and tax avoidance, especially after the 2002 tax sharing reform, to determine whether local government-controlled enterprises engage in tax avoidance to deprive the central government of tax revenue.
- **Research Methods**: Utilizing the unique context of the 2002 changes in the tax sharing ratio between the central and local governments, the study employs empirical analysis to examine the tax avoidance behaviors of local government-controlled enterprises.
- **Research Contribution**: This paper is the first to explore the impact of intergovernmental agency conflicts on tax avoidance from the perspective of government-controlled enterprises, providing new empirical evidence.

## Institutional Background

1. **China's Privatization and Tax Sharing System**: The authors review various reforms implemented over the past three decades to transition from a planned economy to a market economy, focusing on the tax sharing system introduced in 1994. This system was designed to establish an effective fiscal distribution mechanism, enhancing the central government's tax collection and distribution capacity while aligning local government fiscal revenues and expenditures.
2. **Reporting Relationships and Decision-Making Authority**: The study introduces China's "regionally decentralized authoritarian" system, which combines political centralization with economic decentralization. Local governments are responsible for initiating and coordinating economic activities and enforcing laws, while local officials are appointed by the central government, ensuring adherence to central policies.
3. **Sources of Local Government Revenue**: The paper discusses local governments' budgetary and extrabudgetary revenues, with extrabudgetary revenues mainly including post-tax profits of local government-controlled enterprises, administrative fees, and special government funds. Local governments tend to increase extrabudgetary revenues to address fiscal deficits.

## Hypothesis

### Literature Review

The authors highlight the following points from existing literature:

1. **Determinants of Tax Avoidance**: Previous studies indicate that tax avoidance behaviors are related to corporate characteristics, ownership structures, executive compensation, and agency issues. However, there is limited research on the role of governments in tax avoidance behaviors of government-controlled enterprises.
2. **Agency Problems**: Jensen and Meckling's (1976) agency theory primarily explains the conflicts of interest between majority and minority shareholders within a corporation. This paper extends the theory to intergovernmental agency conflicts, exploring the conflicts of interest between central and local governments.
3. **Impact of Tax Sharing Reform**: Existing studies have examined the impact of tax sharing reforms on tax revenue distribution but have not thoroughly analyzed changes in tax avoidance behaviors of government-controlled enterprises post-reform.

### Hypothesis Development

1. **Hypothesis 1 (H1)**: The authors propose that following the 2002 tax sharing reform, local governments are more inclined to engage in tax avoidance when their shareholding ratio in local government-controlled enterprises exceeds the tax sharing ratio. This is because local governments can obtain more post-tax profits through tax avoidance, compensating for the loss from tax sharing with the central government.
2. **Hypothesis 2 (H2)**: The authors further hypothesize that tax avoidance behaviors in local government-controlled enterprises are more pronounced when the local government's shareholding ratio exceeds the tax sharing ratio. This is because the post-tax profits obtained through tax avoidance are higher than the revenue obtained through tax sharing.
3. **Hypothesis 3 (H3)**: From a macro perspective, the authors hypothesize that local fiscal deficits, fiscal composition, and local government tax collection capacity influence tax avoidance behaviors in local government-controlled enterprises. Local governments with significant fiscal deficits are more inclined to increase extrabudgetary revenues through tax avoidance; regions with a higher profit distribution ratio exhibit more prevalent tax avoidance behaviors; and regions with stronger tax collection capacities exhibit less tax avoidance.

## Research Design

1. **Tax Avoidance Measurement**: To accurately measure tax avoidance behaviors, the authors use two modified effective tax rates (METR1 and METR2) and consider the impact of applicable tax rates (ATR). These metrics help eliminate the interference of tax incentives on tax avoidance behaviors, thus more accurately reflecting corporate tax avoidance.
2. **Regression Models**: The authors construct two regression models to test the hypotheses. Model 1 tests Hypotheses 1 and 2, while Model 2 tests Hypothesis 3. The regression models control for variables such as leverage ratio (LEV), firm size (SIZE), intangible assets ratio (SINTS), return on assets (ROA), company age (AGE), and sales growth rate (GROWTH).
3. **Sample Selection**: To ensure representativeness and reliability of the data, the authors select 5201 samples from Chinese A-share companies, excluding the financial sector and non-government-controlled companies. The sample covers five major industries, predominantly manufacturing.

### Regression Equation 1

This model examines the tax avoidance behaviors of local government-controlled enterprises before and after the 2002 tax sharing reform.

$$
\text{METR} = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \text{LG} + \alpha_2 \text{POST2002} + \alpha_3 (\text{LG} \times \text{POST2002}) + \alpha_4 \Delta \text{ATR} + \alpha_5 \text{LEV} + \alpha_6 \text{SIZE} + \alpha_7 \text{SINTS} + \alpha_8 \text{ROA} + \alpha_9 \text{RIGHTS} + \alpha_{10} \text{AGE} + \alpha_{11} \text{GROWTH} + \alpha_{12} \text{DEFICIT} + \alpha_{13} \text{GDP} + \epsilon
$$

Where:
- **METR**: Modified Effective Tax Rate, used to measure tax avoidance behavior.
- **LG**: Dummy variable, valued at 1 if the enterprise's controlling shareholder is the local government, otherwise 0.
- **POST2002**: Dummy variable, valued at 1 for the years 2002 and later, otherwise 0.
- **LG × POST2002**: Interaction term, used to capture the differences in tax avoidance behaviors of local government-controlled enterprises before and after the tax sharing reform.
- **ΔATR**: Change in applicable tax rate.
- **LEV**: Leverage ratio (total liabilities/total assets).
- **SIZE**: Firm size (natural logarithm of total assets).
- **SINTS**: Ratio of intangible assets (intangible assets/total assets).
- **ROA**: Return on assets (pre-tax profit/total assets).
- **RIGHTS**: Dummy variable, valued at 1 if the enterprise conducts additional equity issuance in the following year, otherwise 0.
- **AGE**: Number of years since the company was listed.
- **GROWTH**: Sales growth rate (annual growth rate of sales revenue).
- **DEFICIT**: Local fiscal deficit (total local government expenditure/total revenue).
- **GDP**: Local GDP (natural logarithm of per capita GDP).

### Regression Equation 2

This model examines the impact of local fiscal conditions on tax avoidance behaviors of local government-controlled enterprises.

$$
\text{AvgMETR} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{RPIT} + \beta_2 \text{DEFICIT} + \beta_3 \text{REBR} + \beta_4 \text{GDP} + \beta_5 \text{POST2002} + \delta
$$

Where:
- **AvgMETR**: Province-level annual average tax avoidance level (calculated separately for local government-controlled enterprises and central government-controlled enterprises' average METR1 and METR2).
- **RPIT**: The ratio of provincial government revenue from profit distribution to income tax sharing revenue.
- **DEFICIT**: Local fiscal deficit (total local government expenditure/total revenue).
- **REBR**: The ratio of local government's extrabudgetary revenue from administrative fees and fines to total local government revenue.
- **GDP**: Local GDP (natural logarithm of per capita GDP).
- **POST2002**: Dummy variable, valued at 1 for the years 2002 and later, otherwise 0.

## Empirical Results

1. **Impact of the 2002 Tax Sharing Reform on Tax Avoidance Behaviors**: By comparing the tax avoidance behaviors of local government-controlled enterprises before and after 2002, the authors find that tax avoidance behaviors significantly increased after the 2002 tax sharing reform. **This result supports Hypothesis 1**, indicating that local governments are more inclined to increase post-tax profits through tax avoidance after the tax sharing reform.
2. **Impact of Local Government Shareholding Ratio on Tax Avoidance Behaviors**: Empirical results show that tax avoidance behaviors are more pronounced when the local government's shareholding ratio exceeds the tax sharing ratio. **This result supports Hypothesis 2**, suggesting that local governments are more inclined to compensate for the tax sharing loss with the central government through tax avoidance when their shareholding ratio is higher.
3. **Impact of Local Fiscal Conditions on Tax Avoidance Behaviors**: Empirical analysis also reveals that tax avoidance behaviors are more significant in regions with larger local fiscal deficits, higher profit distribution ratios, and weaker local government tax collection capacities. **This result supports Hypothesis 3**, indicating that local fiscal conditions significantly influence tax avoidance behaviors.
