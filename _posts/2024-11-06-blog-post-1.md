In the intertwined currents of power and capital, the collusion between governments and corporations not only manipulates the market but also plunders public wealth. From Enron to Evergrande, these former giants leveraged improper means under the shadow of government-corporate collusion, transforming the stage of fair competition into a frenzy of divided interests.

# Lies of Evergrande: The Bubble of Government-Corporate Collusion

## From Enron to Evergrande: The Interplay of Power and Capital

In my first blog post, I reviewed the Kangmei Pharmaceutical financial fraud case, introducing the concept of government-corporate collusion. However, this idea didn’t originate from Kangmei; rather, it was inspired by Enron’s history. Enron, once an energy giant, had such a profound impact on the capital markets that anyone studying accounting or finance is bound to know about it.

In examining Enron, most people focus on the company itself and Arthur Andersen, but I noticed another significant name—the Bush family. Enron’s chairman, Kenneth Lay, had close ties with the Bush family and supported their political activities. The company’s predecessor, InterNorth, merged with competitor HNG in 1985, a year after George H.W. Bush was re-elected as vice president in 1984. Despite InterNorth being the parent company, its original CEO was dismissed immediately after the merger, while Kenneth Lay from HNG took over. Lay then moved the headquarters of the merged company back to Houston, in Bush’s political domain. This raised a question: was Enron’s rapid expansion the result of its own efforts or government-corporate collusion?

Now, let’s turn to another high-profile case of this century—the Evergrande financial fraud. In 2024, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) finally issued penalties against Evergrande, sparking public debate. The CSRC’s report described the fraudulent financial reporting as follows:

> Evergrande Real Estate engaged in financial fraud by prematurely recognizing revenue. In 2019, it inflated revenue by 213.989 billion RMB, accounting for 50.14% of that year's revenue, with inflated costs of 173.267 billion RMB and inflated profits of 40.722 billion RMB, representing 63.31% of the total profit. In 2020, it inflated revenue by 350.157 billion RMB, representing 78.54% of that year’s revenue, with inflated costs of 298.868 billion RMB and inflated profits of 51.289 billion RMB, accounting for 86.88% of the total profit.

If Enron showcased “accounting magic” through complex and obscure accounting manipulations, Evergrande’s fraud was simple and crude. Real estate companies recognizing revenue prematurely is almost laughable because properties are so easily verifiable. In China, most real estate projects operate on a pre-sale model: buyers pay before construction begins, developers build, and the property is delivered upon completion. When developers receive prepayments, they record a contract liability, which is later recognized as revenue upon delivery. Real estate, unlike most manufactured goods, is immovable and easy to inspect. When Evergrande’s fraud was revealed, many properties that had been reported as revenue were still under construction, with excavators and cranes visibly on site—utterly absurd. For PwC, this was unlikely undetectable.

However, this blatant fraud drove Evergrande’s expansion and pushed its debt to a staggering 2.4 trillion RMB. With massive debt and lies, should we only focus on Evergrande and PwC? China’s famed missile scientist Qian Xuesen once said that complex issues require a holistic approach. Financial fraud is a complex system; therefore, we must view it comprehensively. Government-corporate collusion offers a broader perspective.

## The Underlying Currents of Government-Corporate Collusion

Government-corporate collusion is an immense topic. To narrow this perspective to the micro-level of a company, we need to explore the influence pathways of collusion.

### Gaining Dominant Market Position through Collusion

One core characteristic of a market economy is competition, often manifesting as multiple companies competing within the same sector. However, when one company resorts to improper means, such as bribery or allying with local officials, the fairness of competition is severely compromised. Through administrative means, this company can eliminate competitors and secure a dominant position.

This unfair market advantage yields significant profits, allowing the company to capture more market share rapidly. However, these profits are not derived from genuine competitiveness but from collusion with officials. Ultimately, the gains from collusion are realized through the company’s profits, which are then divided between the colluding parties.

In this model, government-corporate collusion is effectively converted into actual company profit, as it enables the company to secure more contracts.

### Seizing Public Wealth through Collusion

When discussing collusion-driven wealth extraction, we see that the first method, although simpler and less complex, is relatively inefficient. This method relies on revenue growth through production expansion, which increases costs alongside revenue.

However, a more aggressive approach to seizing public wealth has emerged: direct extraction from the public through collusion. This method became evident in Evergrande’s rapid expansion. Evergrande adopted a “high-leverage, high-turnover” model with a core cycle: buy land for 100 million, obtain pre-sale funds from buyers, mortgage the land for bank loans, then use the funds to buy more land, and repeat.

In this process, Evergrande colluded with local officials. Officials expedited Evergrande’s land acquisitions, allowing it to secure large loans through extensive land holdings. Land auctions generated significant local revenue, bolstering officials’ records. This collusion worsened the situation because Evergrande misappropriated pre-sale funds, which should have been regulated for property construction. Reportedly, part of these misappropriated funds went to Xu Jiayin and his affiliates, while another portion went to colluding officials.

This collusion pathway didn’t create actual profit but rather extracted wealth directly from the public, hollowing out citizens' wealth. While the colluding parties seized their benefits, these gains didn’t appear on financial statements, leading to a mismatch between capital and revenue. Eventually, this gap was filled through financial fraud.

My suspicion of collusion between Evergrande and local governments is not unfounded. To date, several officials closely associated with Evergrande have been investigated or prosecuted, including former Liaoning Governor Tang Yijun, former CITIC Bank President Sun Deshun, and former Guizhou Provincial Party Secretary Sun Zhigang.

## The Bubble Bursts

In my view, Evergrande’s rapid expansion was fueled by corrupt deals between Xu Jiayin’s family and officials. To sustain this false prosperity, Evergrande had to engage in financial fraud. These fraudulent reports extended Evergrande's lifespan and inflated the bubble to an alarming degree under this distorted mechanism.

As the colluding parties continued to plunder citizens' wealth, Evergrande’s debt ballooned to 2.4 trillion RMB. Perhaps, in Xu Jiayin’s view, Evergrande had become “too big to fail.” But he should remember that Enron, once one of the world’s leading energy companies, also met its end.

Fortunately, Evergrande’s lie finally burst; unfortunately, Evergrande’s lie finally burst.
