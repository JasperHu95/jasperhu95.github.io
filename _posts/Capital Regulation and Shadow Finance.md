## Summary

This paper analyzes the impact of increased bank capital requirements under Basel III on the dynamics of regulated bank lending and shadow (non-bank) lending. Using matched firm-lender data from South Korea, the study documents a substantial decline in lending by regulated banks coupled with a corresponding rise in shadow lending. The authors develop a general equilibrium model to replicate these findings and suggest that stricter capital requirements led to a reallocation of credit from regulated banks to unregulated shadow lenders.

## Introduction
The introduction outlines the motivations stemming from the 2008 financial crisis, which led to the global tightening of bank capital requirements under Basel III. The study focuses on the macroeconomic consequences of these regulatory changes, particularly on the shifts in credit provision between regulated and unregulated sectors within South Korea.

## Literature Review

The literature review engages with several studies that have examined the impacts of capital regulations:
- **Bianchi and Bigio (2022)** and **Aliaga-Díaz et al. (2018)** discuss the endogenous capital buffers and the counter-cyclical nature of regulations.
- **Ríos-Rull et al. (2020)** and **Faria-e-Castro (2020)** explore the macroeconomic effects of counter-cyclical buffers.
- **Corbae and D’Erasmo (2021)**, and **Jamilov and Monacelli (2020)** analyze the quantitative impacts of Basel III on bank size distribution and balance-sheet-driven recessions, respectively.
- **De Nicolò et al. (2014)** and others provide insights into optimal regulation using dynamic models with heterogeneous banks.
- **Begenau and Landvoigt (2022)** find that increases in shadow banking activities due to higher capital requirements do not necessarily enhance systemic fragility.

## Research Design
### Regression Equations and Variable Setup
The main regression model used to estimate the impact of capital requirements on bank and shadow lending growth is as follows:
$$ \Delta \ln(\text{credit}_{it}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \ln(\text{Capital Requirement}_{it}) + \epsilon_{it} $$
- $\Delta \ln(\text{credit}_{it})$: Growth rate of credit from bank $i$ at time $t$.
- $\ln(\text{Capital Requirement}_{it})$: Logarithm of the capital requirement for that bank.

### Variables
- **Dependent Variable**:
  - $\text{credit}$: Total loans from banks or shadow lenders.
- **Independent Variable**:
  - $\text{Capital Requirement}$: Tier 1 capital ratio required for banks.
- **Control Variables**: Include various macroeconomic indicators and bank-specific characteristics.

### Robustness Checks
- **Model Specifications**: Execution of various models to ensure consistency across different settings.
- **Dynamic General Equilibrium Model**: Quantifies the direct impacts on banks and spillover effects on shadow lending.
- **Simulated Panel Data**: Empirical estimates are validated against model predictions to ensure robustness.

## Empirical Results

1. There is a significant reduction in regulated bank lending by approximately 25%.
2. An equivalent increase in shadow lending suggests a substantial market shift.
3. The findings are robust across multiple model specifications and control settings, highlighting a systemic shift in the credit market dynamics due to regulatory changes.
