## Summary

This paper  investigates how remote auditing, which has become prevalent post-pandemic, impacts auditor performance, specifically in creative tasks such as hypothesis generation during analytical procedures. The authors examine two key factors: the spatial distance between auditors and clients, and the frequency of supervisor monitoring. They find that working remotely can enhance auditors' creative problem-solving abilities when monitored less frequently, but too much monitoring reduces both creativity and decision quality. Psychological distance due to physical separation increases higher-level cognitive processing, which is beneficial for tasks requiring creativity.

## Introduction
With advancements in technology and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, remote auditing has become more widespread. However, there are concerns that reduced auditor-client interactions and supervision challenges may negatively affect audit quality. The paper explores how spatial distance and monitoring frequency influence auditors’ judgments in creative tasks, such as generating hypotheses for analytical procedures. The study tests whether the psychological distance fostered by remote work can improve performance on complex decision tasks and whether excessive monitoring may hinder this effect.

## Institutional Background
The study is situated within the context of modern auditing practices, which have shifted towards remote work to improve flexibility and reduce pressure. This shift has raised concerns about decreased physical interaction and supervision, potentially impacting audit quality. As accounting firms introduce policies to manage remote auditing, such as increasing supervisor monitoring, it becomes crucial to understand how these changes affect auditor performance. The study examines how spatial distance from clients and frequent monitoring by supervisors influence auditors’ creative decision-making and overall audit quality.

## Hypotheses

### Literature Review
1. **Remote Auditing and Psychological Distance**: Remote auditing can potentially decrease audit quality due to limited auditor-client interaction (Wilson 2017; Johnson & Wilson 2018). According to Trope and Liberman's (2010) construal level theory, greater physical distance increases abstract thinking, which can improve performance on creative problem-solving tasks.
   
2. **Spatial Distance and Cognitive Performance**: Henderson et al. (2011) suggest that spatial distance affects how individuals interpret information. Remote work allows auditors to engage in high-level cognitive processing, leading to better pattern recognition and hypothesis generation (Jia, Hirt, & Karpen 2009).
   
3. **Monitoring Frequency and Creativity**: Frequent supervisor monitoring is often associated with controlling practices that inhibit creativity (George & Zhou 2001; Zhou 2003). Excessive monitoring reduces effort and constrains the freedom to think creatively, which is crucial for tasks requiring abstract thinking (Niehoff & Moorman 1993).

4. **Audit Creativity and Cognition**: Bedard and Biggs (1991) emphasize that auditors often struggle to generate hypotheses and recognize patterns during analytical procedures. Creative cognition can help auditors develop a broader range of potential causes for financial fluctuations.

### Hypothesis Development
Based on the reviewed literature, the authors propose the following hypotheses:
- **H1**: Auditors working remotely will generate more creative hypotheses when monitored less frequently than when monitored more frequently. The difference in creativity will be smaller for auditors working onsite.
  
- **H2**: Auditors working remotely will exhibit higher decision quality when monitored less frequently than when monitored more frequently. For onsite auditors, the difference in decision quality will be smaller.

## Research Design

### Data Source
The study uses experimental data from 179 senior auditors with an average of 36 months of experience. Participants were recruited from Big 4 and other public accounting firms, with 79% from the Big 4. Data collection was split into two rounds, ensuring diversity and robustness. Participants were randomly assigned to one of six experimental conditions.

### Variable Definitions
- **Independent Variables**:
  1. **Work Location**: Three levels—remote from home, remote from the firm office, and onsite at the client’s office.
  2. **Monitoring Frequency**: Two levels—less frequent (status updates every few days) and more frequent (daily status updates).

- **Dependent Variables**:
  1. **Creative Hypothesis Generation**: Measured by the number of unique hypotheses generated and the number of financial accounts referenced.
  2. **Decision Quality**: Measured by the accuracy of identifying the seeded error, rated on a scale from 1 (substantially incorrect) to 6 (substantially correct).

### Model
Although specific regression equations are not provided, the hypotheses were tested using ANOVA and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The SEM models analyze the effects of supervisor monitoring on auditors' sense of constraint, task effort, and creative hypothesis generation. The model suggests that monitoring frequency affects decision quality by influencing how constrained auditors feel, which in turn impacts their cognitive processes.

## Robustness Checks
The authors employed several robustness checks to ensure the validity of their findings:
1. **Sample Diversity**: Results were consistent across two rounds of data collection, despite differences in sample size distribution. Both rounds showed similar patterns in creative hypothesis generation and decision quality.
2. **Alternative Models**: The authors tested alternative SEM models to confirm the robustness of the findings. All alternative models yielded similar results, supporting the initial hypotheses.
3. **Supplementary Measures**: The study measured additional variables such as perceived constraint and task effort, confirming the relationship between monitoring, constraint, and performance.
4. **Temporal Distance**: Additional data were collected to rule out the influence of temporal distance on the perceived monitoring frequency. Results showed no significant differences between experimental conditions.

## Empirical Results

### Creative Hypothesis Generation
   - Remote auditors generated more creative hypotheses under less frequent monitoring and identified more relevant financial accounts. More frequent monitoring led to feelings of constraint, which suppressed creativity.
   - Onsite auditors were less affected by monitoring frequency.

### Decision Quality
   - Remote auditors exhibited better decision quality when monitored less frequently, successfully identifying the cause of financial fluctuations. More frequent monitoring reduced decision-making performance.
   - For onsite auditors, decision quality remained relatively stable regardless of monitoring frequency.

### SEM Analysis
   - SEM models revealed that frequent monitoring increased auditors’ feelings of being constrained, reducing task effort and creative hypothesis generation, especially in remote settings. For onsite auditors, constraint did not significantly affect effort or creativity.
   - In both remote and onsite settings, creative hypothesis generation positively influenced decision quality.

## Conclusion
This study shows that remote auditing, under conditions of less frequent monitoring, enhances auditors’ creativity and decision quality. However, excessive monitoring negates the cognitive benefits of remote work. The findings have important implications for audit firms and standards setters, suggesting that remote work can be effective for certain tasks if supervisory practices are adapted appropriately. Further research should explore whether these results apply to team settings and other audit tasks that do not require creativity.
