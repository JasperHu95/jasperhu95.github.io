# The Effect of Regulatory Harmonization on Cross-Border Labor Migration: Evidence from the Accounting Profession

## Summary
This paper examines the impact of regulatory harmonization on cross-border labor migration within the accounting profession in the European Union (EU). By analyzing the effects of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adoption and the harmonization of statutory audit rules (Directive 2006/43/EC), the authors investigate whether these regulatory changes reduced economic barriers to labor mobility. Using a difference-in-differences (DiD) methodology, the study compares migration patterns of accounting professionals to those of other professions. Results show a significant 20%–22% increase in labor migration within the accounting profession, indicating that harmonization eased mobility barriers. This effect is attributed directly to harmonization rather than an increase in the demand for accounting services.

## Introduction
The paper introduces the concept of global regulatory convergence, particularly within the EU, where such efforts are intended to facilitate cross-border investments and labor mobility. While prior research primarily focuses on the effects of harmonization on capital flows, this study shifts attention to labor mobility. Specifically, it looks at how the harmonization of accounting and auditing standards, through IFRS adoption and Directive 2006/43/EC, impacts the ability of accounting professionals to move across borders. The study posits that harmonization should improve labor market efficiency by removing the barriers created by diverse professional standards.

## Institutional Background
The institutional setting for this study is grounded in the EU's principles of free movement of labor, which allow professionals to work across borders without restriction. Two key initiatives—IFRS adoption in 2005 for public companies and Directive 2006/43/EC harmonizing statutory audits—form the basis of the regulatory harmonization efforts in the accounting profession. Before these changes, accountants faced considerable obstacles when attempting to work in other EU countries due to different national standards. The harmonization of these rules aimed to eliminate these barriers, making it easier for accountants to migrate for work across the EU.

## Literature Review and Hypotheses
The literature review draws on two main streams:

1. **Accounting Harmonization**: Studies, such as those by **Leuz and Wysocki (2016)**, explore whether accounting harmonization enhances cross-border capital flows, noting the potential for increased liquidity and reduced capital costs. Other research, including **Daske et al. (2008)** and **Christensen et al. (2013)**, found that harmonization had modest effects on capital markets, suggesting that labor markets might see stronger impacts.

2. **Cross-Border Labor Migration**: Prior research on labor migration has typically focused on wage differentials, unemployment rates, and explicit legal barriers like immigration laws, as discussed by **Zaiceva and Zimmermann (2008)** and **Skupnik (2013)**. These studies indicate that such restrictions hinder labor mobility. However, the current study posits that implicit barriers, such as differing professional rules, can also significantly deter cross-border migration by increasing the human capital investment required to practice in foreign countries.

### Hypotheses
The authors hypothesize that regulatory harmonization in accounting and auditing will lead to a significant increase in cross-border migration of accounting professionals. This is due to the reduction in implicit economic barriers, such as the need to learn new national accounting standards.

## Research Design
The research employs a difference-in-differences (DiD) design to measure changes in migration rates among accounting professionals compared to other professionals before and after regulatory harmonization. The key elements of the research design are:

### Regression Equation
The primary regression equation used in the study is:

$$
Y_{it} = \alpha + \beta \, Post_t \times Accounting_i + \gamma X_{it} + \delta C_{it} + \epsilon_{it}
$$

Where:
- $Y_{it}$ is the migration status of individual $i$ at time $t$.
- $Post_t$ is a binary indicator for the post-harmonization period.
- $Accounting_i$ is a binary indicator for accounting professionals.
- $X_{it}$ includes demographic control variables such as gender, age, education, and family status.
- $C_{it}$ represents country-year fixed effects to control for macroeconomic shocks.

### Variables
- **Dependent Variable**: Cross-border migration status.
- **Independent Variables**: 
  - $Post$: Indicator for the post-harmonization period.
  - $Accounting$: Indicator for accounting professionals.
- **Control Variables**: Demographics such as gender, marital status, age, education, and presence of children. Country-year fixed effects are included to control for external factors like economic growth and changes in labor market conditions.

### Robustness Checks
To ensure the robustness of their findings, the authors conduct several tests:
1. **Parallel Trends Assumption**: A graphical analysis shows similar pre-treatment migration trends for accounting professionals and control groups.
2. **Double-Matching DiD Analysis**: This method matches accounting and control professionals by exact demographic characteristics (e.g., single males aged 25–29 without children) to control for any composition changes in the survey sample.
3. **Control for Domestic Job Mobility**: The authors include a control for changes in domestic job mobility to ensure that results are not confounded by increased demand for accounting services.
4. **EU-15 Sensitivity Analysis**: By restricting the sample to the EU-15 countries, the authors check whether EU enlargement biased the results.

## Empirical Results
The empirical results support the hypothesis that regulatory harmonization significantly increased cross-border migration among accounting professionals. Key findings include:
1. **Increase in Mobility**: Cross-border migration for accounting professionals increased by 20%–22% post-harmonization.
2. **Harmonization Effect**: The analysis suggests that this increase is driven by regulatory harmonization rather than a general rise in demand for accounting services.
3. **Robustness of Results**: The results hold across different specifications and control groups, including legal professionals and other non-accounting business professionals. The double-matched DiD approach further confirms the robustness of the findings.
4. **EU-15 Results**: Although the migration effect is smaller within the EU-15, it remains significant, highlighting the importance of harmonization even in more developed economies.
