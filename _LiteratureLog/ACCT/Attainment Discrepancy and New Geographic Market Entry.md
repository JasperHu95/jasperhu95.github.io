## **Summary**

This paper investigates how attainment discrepancy—the gap between a firm’s current performance and its aspiration levels—affects decisions to enter new geographic markets, emphasizing the role of managerial pay gaps. The study distinguishes between **vertical pay disparity** (differences in pay between CEOs and top executives) and **horizontal pay dispersion** (variation in pay among executives at the same level). Empirical analysis of S&P 500 firms from 1996 to 2006 aims to address mixed findings in previous literature on the relationship between performance gaps and market entry.

## **Introduction**

The study aims to clarify the ambiguous relationship between performance discrepancies and geographic market entry by introducing managerial pay gaps as moderating variables. Key literature referenced includes:

1. **Chang (1996):** Found no support that underperformance motivates market entry.
2. **Lin (2014):** Suggested underperformance increases geographic scope but found inconclusive results for overperformance.
3. **Ref and Shapira (2017):** Identified an inverted U-shaped relationship between performance and market entry.

The authors propose that managerial pay gaps significantly influence team dynamics, affecting market entry outcomes, especially under different performance conditions.

## **Institutional Background**

The research focuses on large public firms in the **S&P 500** from 1996 to 2006. These firms are significant in the U.S. economy, providing detailed data on executive compensation, governance, and financial performance. The period studied captures challenges posed by globalization and strategic market expansion. The study aims to explore how executive compensation structures—vertical pay disparity and horizontal pay dispersion—moderate the relationship between performance gaps and new market entry decisions.

## **Hypotheses**

The paper develops the following hypotheses:

### **Hypothesis 1: Attainment Discrepancy and Market Entry**
- **H1a:** New market entry increases when performance falls below aspirations.
- **H1b:** New market entry decreases when performance exceeds aspirations.

### **Hypothesis 2: Moderating Role of Vertical Pay Disparity**
- **H2a:** Vertical pay disparity strengthens the effect of low performance on new market entry.
- **H2b:** Vertical pay disparity weakens the effect of high performance on new market entry.

### **Hypothesis 3: Moderating Role of Horizontal Pay Dispersion**
- **H3a:** Horizontal pay dispersion weakens the effect of low performance on new market entry.
- **H3b:** Horizontal pay dispersion strengthens the effect of high performance on new market entry.

## **Research Design**

### **Regression Model**

The study employs the following regression model to test the hypotheses:

$$
NME_{i,t} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 NME_{i,t-1} + \beta_2 C_{i,t-1} + \beta_3 ROA_{i,t-1} + \beta_4 VPD_{i,t-1} + \beta_5 HPD_{i,t-1} + \varepsilon_{i,t}
$$

Where:
- $NME_{i,t}$: Number of new markets entered by firm $i$ at time $t$.
- $C_{i,t-1}$: Control variables at time $t-1$.
- $ROA_{i,t-1}$: Return on assets (performance measure).
- $VPD_{i,t-1}$: Vertical pay disparity (CEO pay minus average TMT pay).
- $HPD_{i,t-1}$: Horizontal pay dispersion (coefficient of variation of TMT pay).
- $\varepsilon_{i,t}$: Error term.

### **Variable Definitions and Control Variables**
- **Dependent Variable:** New market entry, measured as the number of new geographic markets entered.
- **Independent Variables:** 
  - $ROA$: Return on Assets, indicating performance.
  - $VPD$: Vertical Pay Disparity.
  - $HPD$: Horizontal Pay Dispersion.
- **Control Variables:** Firm size, industry performance, corporate governance characteristics, stock volatility, and TMT turnover.

### **Robustness Checks**
1. **Lag Structure:** Independent variables are lagged by one year to control for reverse causality.
2. **Log Transformation:** Applied to variables to address skewness and kurtosis.
3. **Unlogged Versions:** The model was also tested with unlogged variables to ensure consistency in results.

## **Empirical Results**

The empirical findings support the hypotheses:

1. **Hypothesis 1:** 
   - Firms below aspiration levels tend to enter new markets, while those above aspiration levels are less inclined to expand.
2. **Hypothesis 2:** 
   - Vertical pay disparity encourages new market entry in low-performance scenarios but reduces market entry when performance is high.
3. **Hypothesis 3:** 
   - High horizontal pay dispersion negatively impacts market entry across both high and low performance, suggesting that intra-team dynamics suffer under such pay structures.
